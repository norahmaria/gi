Include any relevant error messages. \n\n Send relevant code using code blocks. \n Wrap your code in ${backticks}, with the proper **highlighting**: \n\n **${langCodes}** \n\n To learn more on how to ask a good question, the command !ask will tell you more. \n Once you're done type **!open** to open the channel again.
